For those who dont know, the transfer window is a period of time when soccer clubs  from around the world are allowed to buy players from other clubs, either permanently or on loan. A permanent transfer is when the player moves to another club for good, whereas a loan occurs when the player is given away by its parent club temporarily, usually no longer than a year.  This year, the European transfer window ran from July 27 to October 5. In the English Premier League, multiple clubs massively reinforced their arsenal of players.

 

The club that experienced the most expensive transfer window was Chelsea, bringing in midfielder Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen, goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Rennes, the highly-experienced Thiago Silva from Paris Saint-Germain, Malang Sarr from Nice, Ben Chilwell from Leicester, Hakim Ziyech from Ajax, and lastly, Timo Werner from RB Leipzig for a combined total of $290 million. Aston Villa also reinforced their squad by obtaining Ollie Watkins from Brentford, midfielder Ross Barkley from Chelsea on loan, as well as Emiliano Martinez from Arsenal.

 

Tottenham Hotspur also had a very exciting transfer window, debatably one of the best in the Premier League. They were able to bring back former Spurs player Gareth Bale on loan from Real Madrid for one year. In addition, Tottenham brought in Joe Hart as a free agent, Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid, Pierre-Emile Hjbjerg from Southampton, Matt Doherty from Wolverhampton, and Joe Rodon from Swansea City. Lastly, Spurs finalized a deal that had highly-rated young striker Carlos Vinicius come to north London on a one-year loan from SL Benfica.

 

Tottenhams north London rival, Arsenal, brought in Willian from Chelsea, extended Dani Ceballos loan from Real Madrid for another year, and acquired Pablo Mari from Flamengo, Gabriel from Lille, and Cedric Soares from Southampton. On deadline day, Arsenal were able to obtain the services of Thomas Partey from Atletico de Madrid.

 

Everton brought in experienced midfielder James Rodriguez from Real Madrid, as well as Allan from Napoli and Doucoure from Watford.

 

Manchester City legend David Silva completed a transfer to Spanish side Real Sociedad after a ten-year tenure at the Manchester club. Highly-rated English midfielder Eberechi Eze completed a transfer to Premier League side Crystal Palace from Queens Park Rangers.

 

Holding Premier League champions Liverpool brought in Tsimikas from Olympiacos, Champions League winner Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich, and Portuguese winger Diogo Jota from Wolverhampton.

 

Bayern Munich secured the services of Leroy Sane from Manchester City, Tanguy Kouassi from PSG, Douglas Costa from Juventus, and Eric Maxim Chupo-Moting from PSG.


Spanish giants Barcelona were able to hold onto Argentine legend Lionel Messi amid rumors that he was leaving the Catalan club and also brought in American fullback Sergino Dest from Ajax. Miralem Pjanic also arrived at Barcelona from Juventus,  as part of a swap deal that had Arthur go to the Italian giants.

 

Four-time Premier League champions Manchester City brought in Ruben Dias from SL Benfica, Nathan Ake from AFC Bournemouth, Ferran Torres from Valencia, and Pablo Moreno from Juventus. On the other side of the city, Manchester United extended Odion Ighalos loan from Shanghai Shenhua and also brought in Donny van de Beek from Ajax, Edinson Cavani from PSG, and Alex Telles from Porto.

 

Its definitely been a very busy window for clubs all over the world. From signing free agents to buying players for over $100 million, it was a high-value and extremely productive window. Who do you think got the best value out of this window? Which team looks to be the biggest threat for the upcoming season?
