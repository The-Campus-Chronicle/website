The American Education system is one of the most reformed systems in the modern US, yet it still fails to fulfill its original purpose. There are many reasons that this is the case. Like many other issues in our country, this education gap has always existed mainly due to a lack of a system. This pattern originally appeared in Colonial Europe, eventually leading it to the colonies. However, the largest change to education occurred during the mid-1600s when the first public school opened in Massachusetts. This school, known as the Boston Latin School, was opened to all children without tax dollars being collected. Public education was not brought to the masses, however, until 1865, when it became mandatory for American children to get an education.

The modern education system in the United States took great inspiration from the public education system of some Western European countries, especially Germany. This system was originally introduced to teach children basic skills like arithmetic, reading, and writing, allowing them to be better workers. In the modern day, many people don’t strive to work in factories, making this system impractical. Now that we have looked at the history of this issue, we can dive more deeply into the current problem.
There are numerous causes of the widening divide in education in the United States, including race, poverty, and language barriers, as well as the “digital divide.” The most important of these issues in modern times would have to be the digital divide. This idea is commonly defined by numerous dictionaries. as “the gulf between those who have ready access to computers and the internet, and those who do not.” This divide is more often found in areas where poverty is common and access to luxuries is harder to find. In many impoverished areas, this digital gap leads to a lack of tools that could be used for education and other means of improvement. This issue has been steadily decreasing in the past few years as more government programs have promised to give access to all, one of which is the ACP (Affordable Connectivity Program).

Another large issue causing this widening divide is race. Although racial issues have decreased historically, they are still very relevant to the modern education system. Due to racial persecution, many minority groups have been forced into areas with limited access to education and remained there, decreasing their chances of succeeding in life and scholastically.

Overall this education gap is caused by the abovementioned factors as well as many others,  and the solution is not a one-step process. It will take a significant amount of time and governmental support for this gap to eventually be bridged, but I am firm in the belief that it can be done with the right programs and reforms.
