### **Introduction**
Music is everywhere in our lives, from the songs we listen to on our way to school to the music we dance to. But music does more than just give us something to listen to; it can change emotions, inspire us, and even connect us with others. When I need to focus or when I need to get things done, music calms me enough to help me focus. Let’s explore how music can affect us in different ways.


### **1. Music and Our Feelings**
The most impactful way music affects us is through our emotions. Listening to different genres of music can make us feel different things. For example, a favorite song can cheer someone up when they’re down. On the flip side, when people listen to sad songs, they can relate to them on a personal level, helping them cope. The Cleveland Clinical article What Is Music Therapy, and How Can It Help Me explores the benefits of music on a person's mental health. It notes that “Music therapy has been shown to reduce anxiety, alleviate stress, and enhance emotional well-being.” Studies show that music can reduce stress and help people feel better during difficult situations by engaging the brain in ways that promote relaxation. 

### **2. Music and Our Relationships**
Music brings people together. Whether it’s singing in a choir, going to concerts, or dancing, music instills a sense of belonging between people. The Couture Media article The Influence of Music on Human Relationships and Social Bonds discusses how shared musical experiences can strengthen emotional bonds. It states specifically, “Shared musical tastes can act as a social glue, helping people form stronger emotional bonds within relationships, whether through concerts, group singing, or social events.” As a child, when I would visit my family, we would sing cultural songs and radio songs together. It would bring us closer together and take any awkwardness away. Listening to music together, specifically at a party or social gathering, helps us bond and share special memories.

### **3. Music and Personal Growth**
Many people find music helpful when it comes to expressing themselves and figuring out who they are. Our favorite songs can reflect our values and inspire us to dream bigger.  Songs like “Feet Don’t Fail Me Now” by Joy Crookes and “Change” by Taylor Swift inspire people, like me, to work harder. I also would play songs from my background, Georgia, and my friends would learn more about my culture through it and vice versa. Listening to different genres of music can also teach us about other cultures and perspectives, helping us become more open-minded. 

### **Final Thoughts**
In conclusion, music plays an important role in shaping our lives. It helps us manage our emotions, build relationships, and inspire us. Whether we’re listening to a song that makes us feel understood or playing an instrument that improves our memory, music truly touches every part of who we are. So, if you haven’t already, start listening to music. It’s an easy way to lift your spirits and discover new things about yourself, and others.
