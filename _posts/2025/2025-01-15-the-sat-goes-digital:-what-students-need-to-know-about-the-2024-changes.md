The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), a key college admissions test, is undergoing significant changes in an attempt to make it more student-friendly and better aligned with current educational practices. Since March of 2024, the SAT has shifted to a fully digital format for U.S. students. This transition has also been applied internationally since 2023. The exam will now be shorter, taking two hours instead of three. It will include more reading passages, though these passages are shorter and accompanied by simpler questions, making them more approachable for many students.

As a part of the new features, students will now be able to access a built-in calculator throughout the entire math section as well as reference sheets and a countdown clock on the College Board’s Bluebook app. The shift to a digital format will not only modernize the test format but also speed up the score reporting. Results are now expected to be available in days rather than weeks. The quick results will also help students to sooner determine whether to submit their scores to colleges or retake the exam. 

Another key feature of the digital SAT is its adaptive testing model. The exam adjusts the difficulty of the second section based on a student’s performance in the first section. For example, students who perform well in the first section will encounter harder questions in the second section, while those who struggle will face easier questions. This adaptive format aims to provide a tailored testing experience that reflects each student’s abilities.

The College Board, which is the organization behind the SAT, emphasizes that these updates and modifications aim to create a more accessible and less stressful experience for student test takers. Additionally, students will receive resources for both college and career guidance based on their results, helping them plan for life after high school. 

These changes reflect a response to feedback from both students and educators, who report that the digital SAT feels more straightforward and less intimidating. For those debating between the SAT and the American College Testing (ACT), the SAT’s new format may become a deciding factor. While the ACT will begin to have online tests, it also will still offer paper-based tests, so students preferring digital tests may favor the SAT instead. For more updates and information, details can be found on the  College Board’s website and social media accounts.
