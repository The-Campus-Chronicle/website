Imagine casually listening to your favorite song and watching colors swirl through the air as you do. Maybe you are reading a book and each letter pops out in a different shade. For some people, this is just everyday life. This fascinating, rare condition is called synesthesia, and it basically blends the senses together.

Scientists are still attempting to fully understand this phenomenon, but it is caused by certain areas of the brain that control different senses being connected and active together. It can also be described as “wires crossed” in the brain as more than one sense is activated when only one should be. Many scientists also suspect that it is related to genetics because it often runs in families. However, although this may be true, not every family member will have the same type or intensity of synesthetic experiences.

Some researchers believe that all infants may begin life with more interconnected senses, but most people lose these connections as their brains develop. People with synesthesia might simply keep more of these early pathways. Other researchers are investigating whether synesthesia can be trained or encouraged, and whether it might improve memory or creativity in individuals without it. Although many questions remain, as research continues, synesthesia helps us understand just how amazing and flexible the human brain can be.

There are many different types of synesthesia that blend different senses together. One common type is day-color synesthesia, where each day of the week associates itself with a different color. Another type is auditory-tactile synesthesia, where different sounds can cause you to feel a temperature change, pain, or pressure in a certain area. Sound-color synesthesia causes you to see certain colors when you hear different sounds. Time-space synesthesia is where you visualize things in specific ways, like mapping something out or seeing a calendar in a certain way. Hearing-motion synesthesia is where you hear a certain sound in your head when seeing a certain motion. Mirror-touch synesthesia, one of the more rare and complicated forms of synesthesia, is where you see something happen to someone else, and feel as if it is happening to you. These are only a few of the many types of synesthesia, and they come in different levels of intensity depending on the person.

For many people, synesthesia can provide them with many advantages. People with synesthesia often say that it helps them remember information. If each letter or number has a color, remembering spelling or math facts can be easier. Furthermore, some famous creators, such as musicians, writers, and painters, have credited synesthesia with inspiring their work. For example, composers with chromesthesia sometimes describe creating music based on the colors they see when they hear certain tones.

However, synesthesia is not always helpful. For a number of people, the extra sensory experiences can feel overwhelming or distracting. Being in a noisy and active classroom, office, or any place while seeing flashes of color with every sound can be extremely overstimulating. Still, many people with synesthesia say it enriches their lives and makes their everyday experiences more interesting and memorable.

Synesthesia may be uncommon, but it reminds us that everyone experiences the world differently. Whether it means hearing colors, tasting words, or visualizing time, synesthesia shows that the boundaries between our senses are not always as clear as we think.
